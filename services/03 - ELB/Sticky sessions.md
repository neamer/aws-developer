It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer.

This works for: 
- CLB, 
- [[ALB]] 
- [[NLB]]

This is implemented via a cookie, and we can control its expiration date

The main use case for this is to ensure that the user doesn't lose their session data.

Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load.

*Example*


### Cookies

#### Application-based cookies

- Custom Cookie
	- Generated by the target
	- Can include any custom attributes required by the application
	- Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
	- Can't use reserved names (AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG)
- Application Cookie
	- Generated by the load balancer
	- Cookie name is AWSALBAPP

#### Duration-based cookies

- Cookie generated by the load balancer
- Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB and AWSELB for CLB
