You can buy or register your domain name with a Domain Registrar typically by paying annual charges (e.g. GoDaddy, Amazon Regsitrar...)

The Domain Registrar usually provides you with a DNS Service to manage your DNS records, but you can use another DNS service to manage your records.

For example: You can purchase a domain from GoDaddy and use Route 53 to manage your DNS records.

To do this we:
1. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
2. Update the NS records on the 3rd party website to use Route 53 Name servers
