A user who does not have AWS credentials or permission to access an S3 object can be granted temporary access by using a presigned URL.

A presigned URL is generated by an AWS user who has access to the object. The generated URL is then given to the unauthorized user. The presigned URL can be entered in a browser or used by a program or HTML webpage. The credentials used by the presigned URL are those of the AWS user who generated the URL.

They can be generated using the S3 Console, AWS CLI or SDK

URL Expiration
- **S3 Console** - 1 min up to 720 mins (12 hours)
- **AWS CLI** - default 3600 secs, max. 604800 secs to 168 hours
