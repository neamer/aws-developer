AWS Copilot is a command line interface (CLI) that you can use to quickly launch and manage containerized applications on AWS. It simplifies running applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate, and AWS App Runner.

Copilot creates modern application deployments by default, based on production-ready patterns that include best practices designed by ECS engineers and customers over the years.

It provisions all required infrastructure in the background allowing us to move beyond manual management of lower-level infrastructure, and instead just start thinking about the application and its lifecycle.
