Elastic Container Registry allows us to store and manage Docker images on AWS

We can either store images in private repositories or use a public repositories with the Amazon ECR Public Gallery

ECR is fully integrated with [[ECR]], and is backed by [[S3]]

Access is controlled through IAM

ECR also supports:
- image vulnerability scanning
- versioning
- image tags
- image lifecycle

**Whenever the exam brings up storing docker images, think ECR**
