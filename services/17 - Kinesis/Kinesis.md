Amazon Kinesis cost-effectively processes and analyzes streaming data at any scale as a fully managed service. 

With Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data, such as video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data, for machine learning (ML), analytics, and other applications.

There are four Kinesis Services:
- [[Kinesis Data Streams]] - serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams
- [[Kinesis Data Firehose]] - extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that reliably captures, transforms, and delivers streaming data to data lakes, data stores, and analytics services
- [[Kinesis Data Analytics]] - Analyze data streams with SQL or Apache Flink
- Kinesis Video Streams - Capture, process and store video streams (not part of exam)
