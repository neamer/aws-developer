At-rest encryption:
- Database master & replicas encryption using [[AWS KMS]] - must be defined at launch time
- If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
- To encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted

In-flight encryption: TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificates client-side

IAM Authentication: IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of username/pw)
