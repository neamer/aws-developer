IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a Global service that is used for creating users and assigning them to a group.

When creating a new AWS account, a Root account is created by default. After that we should use IAM to create additonal Users and to add them to groups.
Users don't have to belong to a group and user can belong to multiple groups.

Example of a Group structure:
