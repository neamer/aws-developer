There are different instance types that are optimized for different use-cases.

### Naming convention

Lets look at this instance type: `m5.2xlarge`

- m is the instance class
- 5 is the generation
- 2xlarge is the size within the instance class


### Quick overview of instance types

##### General purpose

Can be used for a diversity of workloads.

Balanced between:
- Compute power
- Memory
- Networking

##### Compute optimized

Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors

Use cases include:
- Batch processing workloads
- Media transcoding
- High performance web servers
- High performance computing (HPC)
- Scientific modeling & machine learning
- Dedicated gaming servers

##### Memory optimized

For workloads that process large data sets in memory.

Use cases include:
- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
- Distributed web scale cache stores
- In-memory databases optimized for business intelligence
- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

##### Storage optimized

Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage

Use Cases:
- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
- Relational & NoSQL Databases
- Cache for in-memory databases (Redis)
- Data warehousing
- Distributed file systems
