Depending on our workload, we can optimize costs by choosing the right option for our EC2 instance

#### On-Demand instances

Good for short workloads, offers predictable pricing by charging per second.

Has the highest cost, but no up front investment.


#### Reserved instances
*(1 & 3 years)*

Good for long workloads

Another option is Convertible reserved instances, for use cases where flexible instances are needed

Up to 72% discount compared to on-demand

NOTE: Only 1 and 3 years

#### Savings plan
*(1 & 3 years)*

Also meant for long workloads.
Instead of committing to a specific instance type, it commits to a specific amount of usage in dollars

#### Spot instances

Meant for short workloads.

They are very cheap, but there is a possibility of losing instances which makes them less reliable.

You define your max price and lose the instance if the current spot price is more than your max.


#### Dedicated hosts

Book an entire physical server

Control instance placement

Useful for software that has complicated licensing model, or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

#### Dedicated instances

No other customer will share your hardware

#### Capacity reservations
